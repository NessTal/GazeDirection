# GazeDirection

Training a classifier to be used in Visual World experiments (experiments in which 4 images are presented on the screen, the participant is listening to a sentence, and the dependent measure is which image the participant is looking at in each time point during the sentence).
The classifier will be trained on webcam videos of participants looking at images on their laptop. The classes are top-right, top-left, botton-right, bottom-left, center, off-screen, and blink.
